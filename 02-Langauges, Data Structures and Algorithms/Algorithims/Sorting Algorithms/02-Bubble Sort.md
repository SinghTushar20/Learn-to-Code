## Introduction
- It is a in-place, comparision based, stable sorting algorithm which repeatedly steps through an unsorted list compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order the algorithm then repeats this process until the list is sorted.
	- With every outer iteration the **largest element** bubbled to the top.
	- An in-place algorithm is one in which we sort the list without any extraneous memory.
	- Comparison based algorithm means that we sort the list by comparing the elements in that list to one another.
	- An unstable algorithm is one in which the relative order amongst duplicate elements is not preserved.

- Time complexity = (n) (Best), (n^2)  (Average, Worst)
- Space complexity = O(1)

- We have 2 variations of Bubble sort one a normal one and the other a little optimised one.

- Don't have much practical use in CS.
