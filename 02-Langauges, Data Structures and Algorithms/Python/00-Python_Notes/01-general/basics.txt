----------

Computer: 
A computer is a device that can execute programs.

Program: 
Program is a software entity designed and developed to automate a particular task.
A program is composed of Code and Data
	
Code: 
Code means instructions.
For a task/subtask a set of instructions are grouped in a unit termed as a function.

Function: 
A function is a set (group) of instructions.
It has a unique name for identification.
It performs a sub task for a program.
It requires a call for execution.

Data: 
Data means information. 
It is of two types: 
Input - Input is the information that a program gets.
Output - Output is the information that a program generates.
Rule - Program Data must be stored in a variable.

Variable:
A variable is a reserved block in memory (RAM).
It is identified by a unique name.
It allows storage and retrieval of data.
It can store one value at a time.
Its value can change.

Stream:
A stream is a channel of data transfer between interconnected devices.
It may be unidirectional or bidirectional and accordingly it allows transfer of information.

Standard Streams:
O/S establishes 3 streams and makes them available for use by the application (Python program).
The streams are:
1) sys.stdin - Standard Input Stream for transfer of data from keyboard to application.
2) sys.stdout - Standard Output Stream for transfer of data from the application to monitor.
3) sys.stderr - Standard Error Stream for transfer of data from the application to monitor.

print:
A predefined function that takes program data and transfers it to sys.stdout for rendering.

input:
A predefined function that fetches data from sys.stdin and assigns the same to program variables.
 
Assignment Operator (=):
Assignment operator (=) is used to read/evaluate the RHS value/expression and assign the result to the variable on the LHS.
It returns the value that it assigns.
It supports cascaded usage.
