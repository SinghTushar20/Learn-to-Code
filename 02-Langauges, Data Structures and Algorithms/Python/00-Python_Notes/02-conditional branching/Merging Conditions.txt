Merging Conditions
----------------------
There are cases when decision making is to be based on a combination of multiple conditions.

Python interpreter may solve all the conditions and evaluate multiple boolean results. Next the multiple results must be merged into one final boolean value, for decision making.

Python provides logical operators:
* and
* or
for merging multiple boolean values.

Final boolean result is evaluated on the basis of following truth tables.

Logical and
---------------
T and T = T
T and F = F
F and T = F
F and F = F


Logical or
---------------
T or T = T
T or F = T
F or T = T
F or F = F

FYI:
1) Python gives higher priority to "logical and" as compared to "logical or".
2) Python applies a short circuit behaviour that skips the evaluation of the RHS condition when:
 * LHS of and is false
 * LHS of or is true
