# Day 8 Recursion in 3 steps

Find the relation between problem and subproblem

Generalise the Relation

Find the Basecase

Don't worry how the subproblem would work (Recursive leap of faith).

Proof of why reccursive function gives solution can be done using Principle of mathematical induction.

# Day 9 Reccursion Problem

# Day 17 Bubble Sort Algorithm

In this sorting algorithm with every pass the largest element bubbles up to the top.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(n)

This can further be optimized using a flag.

# Day 18 Insertion Sort Algorithm

In this sorting algorithm with every pass the elements till that index will be sorted.

Consider it as improved bubble sort where you don't just compare two adjacent integers but keep comparing it to left adjacent until it is no longer shortest.

# Day 26 Hashing

Hashing is a technique not a data structure.
Insert, Search and Delete are done in Average of O(1).

Hashing is implemented in Java as HashSet & unordered_set in C++.

# Day 27 Hashing Problem

Count Distinct Elements: We can do this using set as it only have unique elements or can use map to get the frequency of each element.

Union & Intersection of Two Arrays: We can do this using set as it only have unique elements.

# Day 28 Hashing Problem

Subarray/ Largest Subarray/ Smallest Subarray with the given sum k: Using HashMap or map
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subarray-with-given-sum-1587115621/1

In an Array of 0's and 1's find largest subarray with equal number of zero's and one's.

# Day 29 Count Distinct Elements in every Window of size k

This can be done using sliding window and hash map.

# Day 30 Internal Working of HashMap, HashTable or HashArray

Hash Function

- Divide Modulo
- Weighted Sum

Load Factor

Collision Handling

- Separate Chaining
- Linear Probing
- Quadratic Probing
- Double Hashing

Few other questions which everyone should prepare beforehand (JAVA):

1. What is bucketing in hashmap ?
2. Why hashmap is not recommended in a multi threaded environment ?
3. Implement a hashmap using custom class as key
4. Is it mandatory to override equals and hashcode method ? What will happen if not overridden ?
5. What is the difference between hashmap and concurrent hashmap also explain the working of concurrent hashmap .

# Day 52 Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

Given a list that can grow in both horizontal and vertical directions (right and down), flatten it into a singly linked list.
The conversion should be in such a way that the down node should be processed before the next node for any node.
A multilevel list is similar to the standard linked list except it has an extra field, down, which points to a vertical list. The vertical list can have a horizontal list attached to it and vice versa.
