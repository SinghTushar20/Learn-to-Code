## Demystifying Computers
- Four Layers of a Computer System
	- User
	- Hardware
	- OS
	- Software(Application)
- Electricity will flow from the power socket to the hardware devices like Tower, Monitor, Printer and from Tower to mouse and keyboard. From the Cables connecting Everything from the Tower the data transfer takes place(In case of keyboard and mouse both the data transfer and electricity flow will take place from USB cable). The Data is tranfered from Tower to Monitor and Printer (output devices) and from keyboard and mouse (input devices) to Tower. Finally the user is able to trade information with other computers via Internet connection.
- Tower contains Motherboard, CPU, I/O card, Network Connection, Memory (RAM), HardDrive (Storage).
- What happen when we switch on our PC

- What happen when we load an application

	- An active application can potentially access anything the OS can access and as OS have the access to all the files in our system, any active application may also potentially access any peice of information in our system.

## Demystifying Internet
- The Internet is **a vast network that connects computers all over the world**. Using the Internet, one can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.
- Internet Service Providers (ISP) are the organizations that owns the cables and networking devices that the internet runs on.
- Strict and fixed set of communication rules for any two computers to communicate is called communication protocols.
	- The internet's communication protocol is called Internet protocol (IP).
	- Every device connected with the internet will have an IP address(unique address) assigned to it.

## Hash Functions
- Passwords in databases are stored in hashed form using hash function.
	- Hash functions will take a string and convert it into a gibrish value, the best thing about this is it's only one way i.e. one can't get the string back from the gibrish.
	- Hash functions are irreversible.
- Prime numbers are used a lot in cryptography.

## Common Password Threats
- User Disclosure
- Social Engineering
- Phising
- Key logging(Hardware and Software)
- Wireless sniffing
- Brute Force (Guessing)
- Dictionary attack
- Password Files not Encrypted (That's when hash functions are used)
- Exposed Password with known hash value (That's when salts are used)
- Security Question

## Creating a Good Password
- A good password should be strong as well as easy to remember.
- To make the password strong one should add letters both lowercase and uppercase with digits and special characters.
- To make the password memorable make it tell a story.
- Password management Tips
	- Securely Record your Password
	- Rank your Password
	- Use Password management Software
