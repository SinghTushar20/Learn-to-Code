## Numpy

- NumPy is a low level library written in C and FORTRAN for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- It cleverly overcomes the problem of running slower algorithms on Python using multidimentional arrays and functions that operates on arrays. Any algorithm can then be expressed as a function on arrays, allowing the algorithms to be run quickly.
- NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array called N-d array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.
- In NumPy dimensions are called **axes**.
- NumPy’s array class is called **ndarray**. It is also known by the alias **array**.
  - NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation and are homogeneous.
  - The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory.
