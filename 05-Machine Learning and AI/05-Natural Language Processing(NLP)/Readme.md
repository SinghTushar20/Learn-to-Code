- Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence **concerned with the interactions between computers and human language**, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

  - A natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation.
  - Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing.

- Real World Applications of NLP:

  - Contextual Advertisements (Different Advertisement for different person)
  - Email Client - spam filtering and smart reply
  - Social Media - removal of adult content, opinion mining
  - Search Engines
  - Chatbots

- Common NLP task:

  - Text/Document classification
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Information Retrival
  - Parts of Speech Tagging
  - Language detection and Machine translation
  - Conversational Agents
  - Knowledge graph and QA systems
  - Text Summarization
  - Topic Modelling
  - Text Generation
  - Spell Checking and Grammer Correction
  - Text Parsing
  - Speech to Text

- Approaches to NLP:

  - Heuristic Methods
    - Regular Expressions
    - Wordnet
    - Open Mind Common Sense
  - Machine Learning Based Methods
    - Naive Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVM
    - LDA
    - Hidden Markov Models
  - Deep Learning Based Methods
    - RNN
    - LSTM
    - GRU/CNN
    - Transformers
    - Autoencoders

- Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation due to:

  - ambiguity
  - contextual words
  - colloquialisms and leg
  - synonyms
  - irony sarcasm and tonal difference
  - spelling errors
  - creativity
  - diversity
