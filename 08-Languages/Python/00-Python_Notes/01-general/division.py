#study of division operators

#1) / : generates quotient of division to the accuracy until remainder becomes zero or a recurring value. Ideally a float value is generated.
a = 20/8

#2) // : generates integer quotient of division
b = 20//8

#3) % : generates remainder of integer division
c = 20%8

print("20/7 =", a)
print("20//7 =", b)
print("20%7 =", c)
