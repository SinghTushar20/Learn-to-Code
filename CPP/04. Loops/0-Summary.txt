Loops are iterative statements. As long as the condition is correct the code inside the block {} will continue to run.

There are 4 types of loops in C++ :
    for
    while
    do-while
    for(:)  //To itterate over items of a Collection directly

If you have a number of iteration then go for for loop, if you don't know then while or do-while loop.


Infinite Loops

for(;;){}
while(1){}


Working with digits

if n is a number 
    to get digits from last => n%10 (to get digit) and then do n /= 10 (for next iteration)
    to get digits from start => (n/pow(10,dig-1))%10 and then dig--
    to add dig x at the end of n => n*10+x
    to add dig x at the start of n => x*pow(10,dig)+n
