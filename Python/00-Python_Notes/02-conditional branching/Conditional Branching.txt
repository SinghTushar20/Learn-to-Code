Conditional Branching
Conditional Branching is the ability of the software (program)
to make the system execute one set of statements and skip the
other, or vice versa.

Python supports implementation of conditional branching using
the if, elif and else statements.

if statement
---------------
if statement is used for conditional branching of program code.
if has:
* a criteria 
* a block of code 
* an optional elif statement
* an optional else statement
associated with it.

Python interpreter always evaluates the criteria associated with an if statement and results in a boolean value.
When the boolean result is true then the block of code associated with the if statement executes, otherwise not.

elif statement
---------------
elif statement is used for conditional branching of program code.
elif has:
* a criteria 
* a block of code 
* an optional elif statement
* an optional else statement
associated with it.

elif statement is optionally associated with an if statement and it (elif) represents a secondary criteria that is evaluated on false of the preceeding criteria.

The result of evaluation of elif is a boolean value which on true makes the system execute the associated block of code and on false skips the associated block of code.


else statement
---------------
else statement is used for conditional branching of program code.
else has a block of code associated with it.
else doesnt has a criteria of its own, rather it relies on the false state of the criteria of the preceeding if or elif statement.
When the preceeding criteria evaluates to false then the block of code associated with else statement executes, otherwise not.

It is important to know that else statement is optionally associated with an if or an elif statement.
