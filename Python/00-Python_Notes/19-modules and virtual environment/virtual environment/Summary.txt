A virtual environment is a tool or an aid provided to us by Python to keep the dependencies that we have utilized earlier in a few projects, constant.
Virtual Environment saves the current state of our compiler along with the state of their modules and libraries.
We can also install different packages and “dataframes” in our virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment we can also use:
    py -m venv virtualenv_name  // to create a new virtual environment named virtualenv_name

Once created we need to activate them to start using that env.
    .\virtualenv_name\Scripts\activate  
    (virtualenv_name)$ deactivate   // to deactivate the env

requirements.txt is just like package-lock.json that keeps the record of all the modules installed in that virtual environment.
    pip freeze > requirement.txt    // do this in same dir. of vir. env.

pip install package_name == version // to install a package's specific version
pip install -r .\requirements.txt   // to install all packages of requirement txt file
