1. The Obstacle (I suck!): Overcome the obstacle to learn a valuable skill.
1. `The Dip`: know when to quit, make a smart choice (not everyone can become an Olympic athlete)
1. `Compound Learning`: learn in chunks instead of cramming, Learn small chunks per day to get long term results.
   - >improve by 1% every day and in 70 days you will double

1. Robert Greene - “Mastery”: 3 principles: `curiosity`, `value learning about all else`, `skill-stacking (uniquely combine your skills)`
1. the trick is to have skills that work well together, but are varied enough to allow you to stand out (avoid the most obvious path)
1. `Happiness factors`: identify the areas/things/people that make you happy - if you’re happy, you will be able to learn better
1. monitor your happiness factors, identity 5 things that make me happy.
