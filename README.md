- The Obstacle (I suck!): Overcome the obstacle to learn a valuable skill.
- `The Dip`: know when to quit, make a smart choice (not everyone can become an Olympic athlete)

  >"Is this the best use of my time"
- Robert Greene - “Mastery”: 3 principles: `curiosity`, `value learning about all else`, `skill-stacking (uniquely combine your skills)`
- the trick is to have skills that work well together, but are varied enough to allow you to stand out (avoid the most obvious path)
- `happiness factors`: identify the areas/things/people that make you happy - if you’re happy, you will be able to learn better
- monitor your happiness factors, identity 5 things that make me happy.
